LIME: Low-light Image Enhancement via Illumination Map Estimation
This is a python implementation of the paper - http://www.dabi.temple.edu/~hbling/publication/LIME-tip.pdf

The implementation is done using 2 algorithms.
1. Exact Solver
2. Sped-Up Solver

Sped-Up Solver is implemented using this paper - http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.385.2768&rep=rep1&type=pdf
