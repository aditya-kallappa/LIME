LIME: Low-light Image Enhancement via Illumination Map Estimation
This is a python implementation of the paper - http://www.dabi.temple.edu/~hbling/publication/LIME-tip.pdf

The implementation is done using 2 algorithms.
1. Exact Solver
2. Sped-Up Solver

Sped-Up Solver is implemented using this paper - http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.385.2768&rep=rep1&type=pdf

The test images are taken from https://sites.google.com/view/xjguo/lime

To run the program, execute code.py and wait for the outputs. Once the first outputs are visible, close the output windows and wait for the second set of outputs. If you want to run on customized inputs, run the Exact_Solver.ipynb notebook file (by changing the filename)
